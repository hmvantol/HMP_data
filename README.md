# The human microbiome represented with bubble charts
## November 20, 2015

The <a href="http://hmpdacc.org/">Human Microbiome Project</a> was an NIH-sponsored initiative to characterize the healthy and diseased microbiome from the human mouth, gut, lung/nose, skin, and vagina. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics">Metagenomic</a>, whole genome, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA">16S rRNA</a> sequencing were used to generate taxonomic and functional data.

Taxonomic data was generated by the Human Microbiome Project from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. <a href="http://www.mothur.org/">Mothur</a> software was used to cluster the sequences into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit">operational taxonomic units</a> (OTUs).

I used this microbial community data to create a series of animated bubble charts. Each chart shows an averaged community profile from the healthy human microbiome. Circles are labeled by genus and coloured by class. Circle size is a percentage of each OTU making up the community calculated from several samples.
