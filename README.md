# The human microbiome represented with bubble charts
## November 20, 2015

The Human Microbiome Project was an NIH-sponsored initiative to characterize the healthy and diseased microbiome from the human mouth, gut, lung/nose, skin, and vagina. Metagenomic, whole genome, and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to generate taxonomic and functional data.

Taxonomic data was generated by the Human Microbiome Project from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Mothur software was used to cluster the sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

I used this microbial community data to create a series of animated bubble charts. Each chart shows an averaged community profile from the healthy human microbiome. Circles are labeled by genus and coloured by class. Circle size is a percentage of each OTU making up the community calculated from several samples.
